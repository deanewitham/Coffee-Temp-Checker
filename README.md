# Coffee-Temp-Checker
Tells me when my coffee is drinkable

I am constantly forgetting about coffee that I've made so I made this Arduino project to remind me.
A waterproof temperature probe is put into the coffee. The arduino reads the temperature every 5 seconds.
When the temperature falls below 140, it turns on a green LED. If I didn't notice that and the temperature then 
falls to 135, it sounds a buzzer for half a second. Since making this I've used it every time I've made coffee at home
and it works great!
